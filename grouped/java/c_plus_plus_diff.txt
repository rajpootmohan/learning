POINTERS :
GLOBAL VARIABLES: No way to declare global variables.
PREPROCESSOR: No Pre-processor in java
GOTO: Although the Java language reserves goto as a keyword, there is no goto statement like the one used in C
STRUCT, UNION, TYPEDEF, ENUM: No such Keywords
FREELY PLACED VARIABLES: Java variables can be declared anywhere, as they are needed.
FREELY PLACED METHODS: C requires that function declarations appear before they are invoked, but Java methods can be invoked before they have been declared.
GARBAGE COLLECTION: The Java platform uses a garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory by recycling objects when they are no longer referenced.
