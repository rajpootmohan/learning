  =>debug :will return a tag that renders the object using the YAML format.
    debug @post
  =>to_yaml :displaying an instance variable, or any other object or method, in YAML format can be 
             achieved this way.
    @post.to_yaml
  =>inspect :This will print the object value as a string.
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].inspect           #[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

=>The Logger
  =>Log Levels are :debug, :info, :warn, :error, and :fatal, corresponding to the log level numbers
 	  from 0 up to 4 respectively.	
  =>You can specify an alternative logger in your environment.rb
      Rails.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
			Rails.logger = Log4r::Logger.new("Application Log")              
			Rails.logger.level = 0 # at any time
	=>Or in the Initializer section
	    config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
			config.logger = Log4r::Logger.new("Application Log")
			config.log_level = :warn
 	=>To write in the current log use the logger.(debug|info|warn|error|fatal) method from within a 	 
 	  controller, model or mailer.

=>Debugging with ruby-debug
  =>sudo gem install debugger
  =>rails server --debugger
  =>commands used in debugging:
    =>help
    =>list/l(-/=)
    =>where
    =>frame _n_
    =>instance_variables
    =>var
    =>var const/global/instance/local
    =>display _var_name_  # for watching variables
    =>step+/step- _n_  # move forwards and backwards n steps
    =>next
    =>break line_no
    =>break file:line_no [if expression]
    =>break class(.|\#)method [if expression]
    =>nfo breakpoints _n_ or info break _n_  # to list breakpoints info
    =>delete _n_ # to remove the breakpoint number n
    =>continue [line-specification] (or c): resume program execution, at the address where your script last stopped;
    =>finish [frame-number] (or fin): execute until the selected stack frame returns. If no frame number is given, 
                                      the application will run until the currently selected frame returns
    =>edit [file:line]: edit file using the editor specified by the EDITOR environment variable
