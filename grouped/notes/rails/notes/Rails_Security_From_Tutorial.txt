Cross Site Scripting :
   I'd be very interested in ways to insert some of my JS into your page.
   You manually escape untrusted input, using the h() method.
   Rails 3 and 4 are much better. Output is escaped by default.
   Defence : you need to escape any text that a user has entered.

Cross site request forgery: 
   If a user wants to change their password, they post a form, right? So what happens if the form isn't on your website?
   The request still goes through. Attackers can exploit this fact.
   I know you're logged in to your app as an admin
   I create a "change password" form disguised as something else
   You submit the form and, without realizing it, you've changed your password.
   Defence : rails sidesteps this class of attack by offering CSRF protection. You may know it as "that weird text that gets put in 
             all my forms for some reason.
