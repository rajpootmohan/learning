STATIC TYPING: Any variable, function argument or return value can have its type defined on initialization.
DATA TYPES:
    Number - All numeric values are represented by the number type, there aren't separate definitions for integers, floats or others.
    String - The text type, just like in vanilla JS strings can be surrounded by 'single quotes' or "double quotes".
    Boolean - true or false, using 0 and 1 will cause a compilation error.
    Any - A variable with this type can have it's value set to a string, number, or anything else.
    Arrays - Has two possible syntaxes: my_arr: number[]; or my_arr: Array<number>.
    Void - Used on function that don't return anything.
INTERFACES: Interfaces are used to type-check whether an object fits a certain structure.
            The order of the properties does NOT matter. We just need the required properties to be present and to be the right type.
