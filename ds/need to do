1) Given array containing initial prices of n objects, you can sell either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array
 and can only sell one product each year. The price of each product if selling in year ‘k’ is (k * initial_price of that object).
  You have to maximise the amount when all products are sold.

Q:
You have an array of integers. You have to count the number of inversions in the array. An inversion is when i < j and a[i] > a[j].

e.g = 2,1,3,1,2
Ans 4
Inversions ->
2,1
2,1
3,1
3,2

E.g = 2,4,1,3,5
Ans 3
Inversions ->
2,1
4,1
4,3
