Context:
	You have applied the Microservice architecture pattern. Services must handle requests from the applicationâ€™s clients. Furthermore, services must sometimes collaborate to handle those requests. They must use an inter-process communication protocol.

----------------------- Pattern 1: Remote Procedure Invocation (RPI) ------------------------

Solution
	Use RPI for inter-service communication. The client uses a request/reply-based protocol to make requests to a service.

Examples : There are numerous examples of RPI technologies
	1. REST
	2. gRPC
	3. Apache Thrift

BENEFIT:
	1. Simple and familiar
	2. Request/reply is easy
	3. Simpler system since there in no intermediate broker

DRAWBACK:
	1. Usually only supports request/reply and not other interaction patterns such as notifications, request/async response, publish/subscribe, publish/async response
	2. Reduced availability since the client and the service must be available for the duration of the interaction

ISSUES:
	1. Client needs to discover locations of service instances.

----------------------- Pattern 2: Messaging ---------------------------------------

Solution
	Use asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication. Services communicating by exchanging messages over messaging channels.

Examples : There are numerous examples of asynchronous messaging technologies
	1. Apache Kafka
	2. RabbitMQ

BENEFIT:
	1. Loose coupling since it decouples client from services
	2. Improved availability since the message broker buffers messages until the consumer is able to process them
	3. Supports a variety of communication patterns including request/reply, notifications, request/async response, publish/subscribe, publish/async response etc

DRAWBACK:
	1. Additional complexity of message broker, which must be highly available

ISSUES:
	1. Request/reply-style communication is more complex.
	2. Client needs to discover location of message broker.

----------------------- Pattern 3: Domain-specific protocol --------------------------------

Solution
	Use a domain-specific protocol for inter-service communication.

Examples : There are numerous domain-specific protocols including:
	1. Email protocols such as SMTP and IMAP
	2. Media streaming protocols such as RTMP, HLS, and HDS
