1. The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

2. Let’s assume that you are searching for a job as a software engineer and very interested in a company named ‘Banana Inc.’. So, you contacted their Hiring Manager and gave him your contact number. He ensured you that if there is any vacancy they will let you know. And there are several other candidates interested too, like you. They will let all of the candidates know about the vacancy and maybe if you respond then they will conduct an interview. So, how is this scenario related to ‘Observer’ design pattern? Here, the company ‘Banana Inc.’ is the Subject which is maintaining a list of all the Observers (candidates like you) and will notify the observers for a certain event ‘vacancy’.
