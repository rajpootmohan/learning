1. Observer vs pub-sub:
	1. In the Observer pattern, the Observers are aware of the Subject, also the Subject maintains a record of the Observers. Whereas, in Publisher/Subscriber, publishers and subscribers donâ€™t need to know each other. They simply communicate with the help of message queues or broker.
	2. In Publisher/Subscriber pattern, components are loosely coupled as opposed to Observer pattern.
	3. Observer pattern is mostly implemented in a synchronous way, i.e. the Subject calls the appropriate method of all its observers when some event occurs. The Publisher/Subscriber pattern is mostly implemented in an asynchronous way (using message queue).
	4. Observer pattern needs to be implemented in a single application address space. On the other hand, the Publisher/Subscriber pattern is more of a cross-application pattern.
