# Design the Twitter timeline and search

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

### Use cases

* User posts a tweet
    * Service pushes tweets to followers, sending push notifications and emails
* User views the user timeline (activity from the user)
* User views the home timeline (activity from people the user is following)
* User searches keywords
* Service has high availability

#### Out of scope

* Service pushes tweets to the Twitter Firehose and other streams
* Service strips out tweets based on user's visibility settings
    * Hide @reply if the user is not also following the person being replied to
    * Respect 'hide retweets' setting
* Analytics

### Constraints and assumptions

General

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
* Posting a tweet should be fast
    * Fanning out a tweet to all of your followers should be fast, unless you have millions of followers
* 100 million active users
* 500 million tweets per day or 15 billion tweets per month
    * Each tweet averages a fanout of 10 deliveries
    * 5 billion total tweets delivered on fanout per day
    * 150 billion tweets delivered on fanout per month
* 250 billion read requests per month
* 10 billion searches per month

Timeline

* Viewing the timeline should be fast
* Twitter is more read heavy than write heavy
    * Optimize for fast reads of tweets
* Ingesting tweets is write heavy

Search

* Searching should be fast
* Search is read-heavy

### Calculate usage

* Size per tweet:
    * `tweet_id` - 8 bytes
    * `user_id` - 32 bytes
    * `text` - 140 bytes
    * `media` - 10 KB average
    * Total: ~10 KB
* 150 TB of new tweet content per month
    * 10 KB per tweet * 500 million tweets per day * 30 days per month
    * 5.4 PB of new tweet content in 3 years
* 100 thousand read requests per second
    * 250 billion read requests per month * (400 requests per second / 1 billion requests per month)
* 6,000 tweets per second
    * 15 billion tweets per month * (400 requests per second / 1 billion requests per month)
* 60 thousand tweets delivered on fanout per second
    * 150 billion tweets delivered on fanout per month * (400 requests per second / 1 billion requests per month)
* 4,000 search requests per second

Handy conversion guide:

* 2.5 million seconds per month
* 1 request per second = 2.5 million requests per month
* 40 requests per second = 100 million requests per month
* 400 requests per second = 1 billion requests per month
