TABLE DESIGN GENERALITIES:

1. How Will your Table Primarily be Used?
	A. If you will be updating certain pieces of data often, it is often best to have those in their own table.
2. What Kind of Data Types are Required?
	A. if there are a limited number of valid entries for a specific field that takes string values, you could use the "enum" type instead of "varchar".
3. Which Columns Will You be Querying?
	A. Indexing columns that you expect to use for searching helps immensely.
	B. Use Explain to Find Points to Index in Queries

OPTIMIZING QUERIES FOR SPEED:

1. Certain operations are more computationally intensive than others. There are often multiple ways of getting the same result, some of which will avoid costly operations.
2. If your queries use "or" comparisons, and the two components parts are testing different fields, your query can be longer than necessary.
