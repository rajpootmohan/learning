PARTITION TOLERANCE: 
In the context of a database cluster, cluster continues to function even if there is a “partition” (communications break) between two nodes (both nodes are up, but can’t communicate).

QPS: query per second

SHARDING: (Advantages)
	A. High Availability
	B. Faster Queries
	C. More write Bandwidth
	D. Data are denormalized
	E. Data are parallelized across many physical instances
	F. Date are kept small

SHARDING: (Problems)
	A. Rebalancing data
	B. Joining data from multiple shards
	C. Implementing shards is not supported.
