1. EXPIRE:
	a. All the operations that conceptually alter the value stored at the key without replacing it with a new one will leave the timeout untouched.
	b. Keys expiring information is stored as absolute Unix timestamps. This means that the time is flowing even when the Redis instance is not active.

2. HOW REDIS EXPIRES KEYS:
	a. Redis keys are expired in two ways: a passive way, and an active way.
	b. A key is passively expired simply when some client tries to access it, and the key is found to be timed out.
	c. Below is what Redis does 10 times per second:
		1. Test 20 random keys from the set of keys with an associated expire.
		2. Delete all the keys found expired.
		3. If more than 25% of keys were expired, start again from step 1.

3. EXPIRES ARE HANDLED IN THE REPLICATION LINK AND AOF FILE:
	a. In order to obtain a correct behavior without sacrificing consistency, when a key expires, a DEL operation is synthesized in both the AOF file and gains all the attached slaves.
	b. This way the expiration process is centralized in the master instance, and there is no chance of consistency errors.
