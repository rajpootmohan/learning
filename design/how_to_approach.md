# How to Approach Design Problems 

## 1. Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions(Gather requirements and scope the problem.)
1. Who is going to use it?
2. How are they going to use it?
3. How many users are there?
4. What does the system do?
5. What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
6. How much data do we expect to handle?
7. How many requests per second do we expect?
8. What is the expected read to write ratio?

## 2. Create a high level design:(Outline a high level design with all important components.)
1. Sketch the main components and connections
2. Justify your ideas

## 3. Design core components:(Dive into details for each core component.)
1. API and object-oriented design
