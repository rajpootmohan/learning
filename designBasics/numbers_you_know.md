## Points to Consider 

1. Writes are 40 times more expensive than reads.
2. By using a cheap compression algorithm a lot (by a factor of 2) of network bandwidth can be saved.
3. Read sequentially from disk at 30 MB/s
4. Read sequentially from 1 Gbps Ethernet at 100 MB/s
5. Read sequentially from SSD at 1 GB/s
6. Read sequentially from main memory at 4 GB/s
7. 6-7 world-wide round trips per second
8. 2,000 round trips per second within a data center
